# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock-Game is a game of chance that expands over time. 
Sheldon and Raj use it to settle a dispute about what to watch on TV in "The Lizard-Spock Expansion". 
Likewise, In "The Rothman Disintegration", Sheldon explains the rules   of this game to Penny and Barry Kripke again.
I decided to enhance my python skills by taking time to learn to build this game.
It only requires any IDE, (but I used Visual studio code) and python installation in your computer system to enjoy the game.
